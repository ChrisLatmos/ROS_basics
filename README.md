# ROS_basics
In this repository I have uploaded some of the fundamental tasks I completed during my first steps in ROS.

I have tried to add comments or README files to as many packages and scripts as possible.

Packages:

beginner_tutorials (ROS wiki)

auto_vehicle (obstacle avoidance algorithm for stdr_simulator)

mapping (gmapping launch file)

simple_robot_msgs: contains the msg files for the simple_robot pkg
simple_robot: r4a tutorials.pdf task 1.6

using_markersch: https://wiki.ros.org/rviz/Tutorials/Markers%3A%20Basic%20Shapes "translated" to Python
