How to start the mapping proccess:

1) In a new terminal start recording your simulator
$rosbag record -O file_name.bag /robot0/laser_0 /tf

2) Fire up the simulator (preferably with rviz). You can also make a .launch file to 
run simulator + rviz + robot_movement_node

3) Explore the map

4) After you are finished, CLOSE ALL TERMINALS

5) In a new terminal 
$rosparam set use_sim_time true
$rosrun mapping gmapping.launch

6) In a new terminal 
$rosbag play --clock file_name.bag

7) After the rosbag has finished, in a new terminal run:
$rosrun map_server map_saver

The map will be saved in the directory you are currently in.
